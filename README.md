# obieverb
Oberlin-specific concert hall reverb macOS app. Made with Andrew Tripp, who recorded the impulse responses used.

Distributed <here> and used by a number of people in the Oberlin community during the beginning year of the COVID-19 pandemic (on a record, and a few recitals).

Built using HTML 5's WebAudio, will note more soon...
